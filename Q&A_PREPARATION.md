# TeamCity Configuration as Code - Q&A Preparation

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Questions & Expert Answers

### Technical Questions

#### Q: "How do you handle environment-specific configurations?"

**Short Answer:**
"We use TeamCity parameters and conditional logic. Different branches can have different configurations, and we can use environment variables for sensitive data."

**Detailed Answer:**
```kotlin
// Example: Environment-specific configuration
project {
    params {
        param("ENVIRONMENT", "development")
        param("DATABASE_URL", "%env.DATABASE_URL%")
    }
    
    buildType {
        id("DeployToEnvironment")
        name = "Deploy to %ENVIRONMENT%"
        
        steps {
            script {
                scriptContent = """
                    if [ "%ENVIRONMENT%" = "production" ]; then
                        echo "Deploying to production with extra safety checks..."
                        # Production-specific steps
                    else
                        echo "Deploying to %ENVIRONMENT%..."
                        # Development/staging steps
                    fi
                """.trimIndent()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Use TeamCity parameters for environment variables
- Conditional logic based on branch names or parameters
- Environment-specific build steps and configurations
- Secure handling of sensitive data through environment variables

#### Q: "What about complex build chains and dependencies?"

**Short Answer:**
"The DSL supports complex dependency graphs. We can define build chains, parallel execution, and conditional dependencies all in code."

**Detailed Answer:**
```kotlin
// Example: Complex build chain
buildType {
    id("FullPipeline")
    name = "Full CI/CD Pipeline"
    
    dependencies {
        // Sequential dependencies
        snapshot(RelativeId("CodeQuality")) {
            onDependencyFailure = FailureAction.FAIL_TO_START
        }
        
        snapshot(RelativeId("TestSuite")) {
            onDependencyFailure = FailureAction.FAIL_TO_START
        }
        
        // Parallel dependencies
        snapshot(RelativeId("SecurityScan")) {
            onDependencyFailure = FailureAction.IGNORE
        }
        
        // Conditional dependencies
        snapshot(RelativeId("PerformanceTest")) {
            onDependencyFailure = FailureAction.IGNORE
            runOnSameAgent = false
        }
    }
    
    triggers {
        vcs {
            branchFilter = "+:main"
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Sequential and parallel execution
- Conditional dependencies based on failure modes
- Cross-agent dependencies for parallel processing
- Complex trigger conditions

#### Q: "How do you migrate existing UI configurations to DSL?"

**Short Answer:**
"TeamCity provides tools to generate DSL from existing UI configurations. We can also do this incrementally, starting with new projects."

**Detailed Answer:**

**Migration Strategies:**

1. **Generate DSL from UI:**
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Versioned Settings
   - Click "Generate DSL from current settings"
   - Review and commit the generated code

2. **Incremental Migration:**
   ```kotlin
   // Start with new build configurations
   buildType {
       id("NewFeature")
       name = "New Feature Build"
       // Define new configuration in DSL
   }
   
   // Gradually migrate existing ones
   // Keep UI configurations for complex legacy builds initially
   ```

3. **Hybrid Approach:**
   - Use DSL for new projects
   - Keep UI for complex legacy configurations
   - Migrate incrementally as teams become comfortable

**Key Points:**
- No need for big-bang migration
- TeamCity provides migration tools
- Can coexist with UI configurations
- Gradual adoption reduces risk

   ```kotlin
   // Base configuration shared across environments
   fun createBaseBuild() = buildType {
       steps {
           script {
               name = "Common Build Step"
               scriptContent = "echo 'Building application...'"
           }
       }
   }
   
   // Environment-specific overrides
   buildType {
       id("DevBuild")
       name = "Development Build"
       steps {
           script {
               name = "Dev-Specific Step"
               scriptContent = "echo 'Development environment setup'"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Parity:**
   - Same configuration code for all environments
   - Environment-specific parameters only
   - Automated environment creation
   - Regular drift detection and correction

3. **Validation and Testing:**
   - Configuration validation scripts
