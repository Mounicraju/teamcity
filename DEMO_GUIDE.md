4. **Versioned Settings**: Enable in TeamCity project settings

### Configuration Steps
1. **Update Repository URL**: In `.teamcity/settings.kts`
2. **Set Parameters**: Configure any required credentials
3. **Test Builds**: Ensure all builds work correctly
4. **Prepare Demo Data**: Have sample changes ready

### Demo Environment
- **Clean Repository**: Start with a clean state
- **Backup Configuration**: Keep a backup of working config
- **Test Scenarios**: Pre-test all demo scenarios
- **Fallback Plan**: Have UI configuration as backup

## üìä Key Metrics to Track

## ‚ùì Common Questions & Answers

### Q: How complex is this to set up?
**A**: Initial setup requires some learning, but maintenance is easier than manual configuration.

### Q: What if the configuration breaks?
**A**: Version control allows easy rollback, and configuration can be tested before deployment.

### Q: How do we migrate from UI configuration?
**A**: TeamCity provides tools to export existing configurations to DSL format.

### Q: What about security?
**A**: Sensitive data should be stored as TeamCity parameters, not in code.

### Q: How do we handle different environments?
**A**: Use conditional logic and environment-specific parameters in the configuration.
